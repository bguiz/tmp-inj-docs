# Getting Started

Injective is the only blockchain specifically designed for cross-chain trading, derivatives, DeFi, and Web3 applications. Injective is poised to become the premier destination for DeFi ecosystem builders globally. It already has one of the fastest-growing exchange applications of all time, which promotes further confidence among developers looking to deploy on Injective.

* **Built for DeFi:** Create novel DeFi applications with fast block times, zero gas fees and instant transaction finality.
* **Order book Infrastructure**: Native decentralized order book infrastructure that can support all financial primitives (spot, perpetuals, expiry contracts, indices, etc.)
* **Ethereum compatibility:** Leverage Injective's native Ethereum compatibility in your applications while scaling transactions to be 1000X faster and cheaper than Ethereum.
* **Unprecedented interoperability:** Explore limitless possibilities for cross-chain interoperability across Ethereum, Cosmos and 23+ prominent layer-one networks.
* **MEV Resistant**: Complete MEV resistance due to the Injective Chain’s frequent batch auction consensus mechanism.
* **Fully customizable:** Ship your products with the ability to swiftly modify any parameter to fit your DeFi and Web3 use case.
* **Dual Smart Contract Layer**: Deploy dApps on CosmWasm or EVM to suit your needs.
* **Horizontal scalability:** Run your application across parallel chains to reach millions of users with infinite scalability.
* **Intuitive developer experience:** Iterate your dApps rapidly with familiar tooling, mainstream languages (Go/Rust), negligible costs and low barriers to entry.
* **Highly secure:** Protected by a distributed group of global validators with a proven track record in crypto and major traditional finance institutions.
* **Environmentally friendly:** Injective’s consensus mechanism leads to a 99% lower carbon footprint.

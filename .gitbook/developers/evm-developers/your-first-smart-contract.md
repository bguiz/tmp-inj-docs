# Your First Smart Contract

{% hint style="info" %}
* You can find the chain details on the [evm-developers.md](../evm-developers.md "mention") page
* You can find an example of a simple Counter contract and deployment instructions within the [injective-foundry-example](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/injective-foundry-example).&#x20;
* You can also read our general-purpose [private-testnet-deployment.md](guides/private-testnet-deployment.md "mention") guides.
{% endhint %}

Building and Deploying smart contracts on Injective should be quite simple. As your first example, we'll take a look at a simple Counter smart contract example.&#x20;

1. We'll develop the smart contract,&#x20;
2. Do a[private-testnet-deployment.md](guides/private-testnet-deployment.md "mention") on the Injective's Private EVM Testnet,
3. Query the smart contract using [Cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/),
4. Send a transaction to change the smart contract state using [Cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/),

## Requirements

{% hint style="info" %}
You can request private EVM testnet funds [here](https://k8s.testnet.evmix.faucet.injective.network/)
{% endhint %}

1. The guide uses [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for deployments. Install it by running:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

To verify the installation:

```
forge --version
```

2. Add Injective EVM to your `foundry.toml`

```
[rpc_endpoints]
injectiveEvm = "https://k8s.testnet.evmix.json-rpc.injective.network"
```

## Development

We can build a simple **Counter** example and then do a transaction/query the smart contract state.&#x20;

### Smart Contract Code

This is just a simple Counter smart contract written in Solidity.&#x20;

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public number;

    event ValueSet(address indexed sender, uint256 newValue);
    event UserRevert(address indexed sender, string reason);

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
        number = newNumber;
        emit ValueSet(msg.sender, number);
    }

    function increment() public {
        number++;
        emit ValueSet(msg.sender, number);
    }

    function userRevert(string memory reason) public {
        emit UserRevert(msg.sender, reason);
        revert("user requested a revert; see event for details");
    }
}
```

### Deployment

You can read more about the process of [private-testnet-deployment.md](guides/private-testnet-deployment.md "mention") in the page referenced in the link.&#x20;

### Querying the Smart Contract

#### Using Injective

```
// WiP
```

#### Using Casttive

Let's query the smart contract state using [Cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/)

```bash
cast sig "function number() returns (uint256)"
0x8381f58a

cast call --rpc-url injectiveEvm {SmartContractAddress} 0x8381f58a
```

### Transactions against the Smart Contract

#### Using Injective

```
// WiP
```

#### Using Cast

Let's make a transaction and change the smart contract state using [Cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/)

```bash
cast sig "function increment()"
0xd09de08a

cast send --rpc-url injectiveEvm --private-key {YourPrivateKey} {SmartContractAddress} 0xd09de08a
```

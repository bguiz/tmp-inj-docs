# Create a wallet

Creating a wallet on Injective is as simply as sending some funds to your Injective address. In this document we'll outline how to create a wallet using some popular wallet solutions (Metamask, Ledger, etc), but also how to create and fund a wallet using `injectived` in a local CLI environment.&#x20;

### Browser Wallets&#x20;

You can create an Injective wallet using your preferred wallet by following the [tutorial on our blog](https://blog.injective.com/en/how-to-create-an-injective-wallet-2/).&#x20;

### Local Wallets

You can create an Injective wallet for your development purposes using [injectived](../../toolkits/injectived/ "mention") in a CLI environment. You can do that using the `injectived keys` [command](../../toolkits/injectived/advanced.md#keys).&#x20;

You can also learn more about keyring management using `injectived` on this page [1.-setting-up-the-keyring.md](../../nodes/getting-started/running-a-node/1.-setting-up-the-keyring.md "mention")
